I created two issues with my html and css. 
Any suggestions for the html or css are greatly appreciated. 
Udacity Project 1 V2

11/14/14
Project complete and sent off to Udacity with a 6.88% mismatch rate. I hoped to get it lower, but my fiddling around with the margins and padding and font-size only threw my rate back into the teens. My personality, I could fiddle with it and drive myself crazy. Better to be happy with 6% and move on to project 2. There is much to learn. My skills will improve with practice. Much practice.
